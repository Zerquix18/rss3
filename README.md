# RSS3

This was an attempt at building something using RSS3 for the [RSS3 bounty](https://gitcoin.co/issue/naturalselectionlabs/gitcoin/1/100028893). I was ultimately unable to understand the project well enough to make something useful, although I did learn a bit how the SDK works, and I can publish stuff to feeds using it.

The result can be found at:

https://rss3.netlify.app/

with a profile page at:

I don't expect to get anything from this since it isn't useful at all. It may just help other developers see how to interact with RSS3 in a browser environment, using Create React App and MetaMask.
